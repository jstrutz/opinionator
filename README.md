# OPINIONATOR

A real-time opinion-updating app, in the tradition of Hot or Not.  

## What does it do?

Given two choices, a user picks one.  This updates the [ELO score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), which in turn affects the rankings.  Since the application is written using the [MeteorJS](http://meteor.com) framework, it is live updating.

## How do I use it?

  * Install meteor: `curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh` , or see [more detailed meteor installation instructions](http://docs.meteor.com/)
  * Check out this application
  * Execute `meteor`
  * Alternatively, see [http://opinionator.meteor.com](http://opinionator.meteor.com) for an already-deployed version
